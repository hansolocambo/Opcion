Version 1.1.0

   Integrated list view into main window.

   Integrated favourite fonts into the main window. Favourite fonts can now be viewed like system/other fonts.

   Added add/remove to favourite fonts button in the sample text area. You can also add or remove a font to favourites by pressing the space key.

   Added bold, italic and underline functionality for sample text. These font effects will not effect fonts in the list view.

   Added shortcut keys for navigating fonts. See shortcuts under the help menu.

   Removed ability to set font size in list view. This can now be done from the sample text area.
